Geometric algebra (GA) allows for a compact description of Maxwell's equations in either an explicit 3D representation or a STA (SpaceTime Algebra
\citep{doran2003gap}) representation.  The 3D GA and STA representations Maxwell's equation both the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:potentialMethods:1280}
L \bcF = J,
\end{equation}
where \( J \) represents the sources, \( L \) is a multivector gradient operator that includes partial derivative operator components for each of the space and time coordinates, and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:potentialMethods:1020}
\bcF = \bcE + \eta I \bcH,
\end{equation}
is an electromagnetic field multivector, \( I = \Be_1 \Be_2 \Be_3 \) is the \R{3} pseudoscalar, and \( \eta = \sqrt{\mu/\epsilon} \) is the impedance of the media.

When Maxwell's equations are extended to include magnetic sources in addition to conventional electric sources (as used in antenna-theory \citep{balanis2005antenna} and microwave engineering \citep{pozar2009microwave}), they take the form
\input{../ece1229-antenna/MaxwellsStatement.tex}

The corresponding GA Maxwell equations in their respective 3D and STA forms are
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:potentialMethods:1300}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:potentialMethods:300}
\lr{ \spacegrad + \inv{v} \PD{t}{} } \bcF
=
%\inv{\epsilon v}
\eta
\lr{ v q_\txte - \bcJ }
+ I \lr{ v q_\txtm - \bcM }
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:potentialMethods:320}
\grad \bcF = \eta J - I M,
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where the wave group velocity in the medium is \( v = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu} \), and the medium is isotropic with
\( \bcB = \mu \bcH \), and \( \bcD = \epsilon \bcE \).  In the STA representation, \( \grad, J, M \) are all four-vectors, the specific meanings of which will be spelled out below.

How to determine the potential equations and the field representation using the conventional distinct Maxwell's \cref{eqn:chapter3Notes:19} is well known.  The basic procedure is to consider the electric and magnetic sources in turn, and observe that in each case one of the electric or magnetic fields must have a curl representation.  The STA approach is similar, except that it can be observed that the field must have a four-curl representation for each type of source.  In the explicit 3D GA formalism
\cref{eqn:potentialMethods:300} how to formulate a natural potential representation is not as obvious.  There is no longer an reason to set any component of the field equal to a curl, and the representation of the four curl from the STA approach is awkward.  Additionally, it is not obvious what form gauge invariance takes in the 3D GA representation.
